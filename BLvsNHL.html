		<h2>TOP 10 REASONS BEER LEAGUE IS HARDER THAN THE NHL</h2>
			<div class="lback">
				<ol>
					<li class="grey"><h3 class="dgrey">Wife's Permission</h3><p class="reason">Most married men not only need permission to sign up for a league, but often times to attend each and every game.</p></li>
					<li class="grey"><h3 class="dgrey">Someone Forgets to Bring Beer</h3><p class="reason">It's called beer league, yet someone will still forget. Even then, when they do remember, it's NattyLight</p></li>
					<li class="grey"><h3 class="dgrey">Goalies Dont Show Up On Time</h3><p class="reason">You spend the first period with six on the ice as your opponents take potshots at the open net. Or… when you find out that your goalie can’t make it, you run around the rink, waiting for other games to end to ask tired and sweaty goaltenders if they can sub right then and there.</p></li>
					<li class="grey"><h3 class="dgrey">Playing the Entire Game with No Bench</h3><p class="reason">Typically, skaters want more ice time. But when there aren’t even enough subs for a full line change, the legs get a bit… tired. So you’ve got to sacrifice some of your game to preserve energy. First on the list? Back-checking. It could be worse though. You can be on a team with a guy who plays 3-4 minute shifts. His reason? He wasn’t yet tired.</p></li>
					<li class="grey"><h3 class="dgrey">Suspensions for Fighting</h3><p class="reason">The professionals, aka our idols, fight, sit for five minutes, then leave and beat each other up again. We get in a fight? Suspensions and expulsions. So much for vigilante justice.</p></li>
					<li class="grey"><h3 class="dgrey">Terrible Ice</h3><p class="reason">In 2010 the Verizon Center in D.C. made news because the Capitals and their opponents agreed that the ice was consistently terrible. Though measures were taken to improve the conditions, beer league players would love to have ice that’s cut between periods and half as good as the Verizon Center on a bad day.</p></li>
					<li class="grey"><h3 class="dgrey">No Instant Replay / Only Two Refs</h3><p class="reason">When an NHL player scores but the refs don’t see it, the replay goes to Toronto. When it happens in beer league hockey, it’s cause for a temper tantrum and a trip to the penalty box for unsportsmanlike conduct. Plus, the NHL has two refs and two linesmen. Beer leagues only staff two refs. So, it’s more likely that there will be missed calls in the beer league.</p></li>
					<li class="grey"><h3 class="dgrey">Locker Rooms</h3><p class="reason">Beer league players routinely get staph infections in the dankest, most disgusting locker rooms ever, with phlegm wads and crap all over the place. While the locker-rooms are bad, the equipment bags are even worse. In the NHL they have equipment managers who keep the pads clean and relatively fresh.</p></li>
					<li class="grey"><h3 class="dgrey">Late Night on Weekdays</h3><p class="reason">The earliest games start at 7pm with most games being at 9, 10 or 11pm. Even worse than the late start, it’s difficult to sleep after games due to the adrenaline, which makes it difficult to wake up on time and get to work the next day.</p></li>
					<li class="grey"><h3 class="dgrey">Playing Without Fans</h3><p class="reason">Granted, the number of people in the stands shouldn’t have an effect on the game, and some NHL teams don’t exactly sell out themselves, but it’s kind of sad when the only audience you have are a few of the guys who are playing in the game after yours.</p></li>
